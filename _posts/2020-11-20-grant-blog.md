title: Grant Blog #1
---
I am writing a grant proposal on a Digital Humanities project where I am educating people on how to make their social media more accessible. I am teaching people how to use closed-captions, alt-text, and overall formatting guidelines through tutorials that I create. I intend to make my project interactive through these tutorials much like the [Markdown Tutorial](https://www.markdowntutorial.com/) that we used early on in the class. Making tutorials is crucial to this project because I want people that use my project to see the practical uses of the accessibility that I’m talking about as well as learn how to apply them in real time.

I chose this project because I noticed that much of digital media excludes a lot of people because it is not accessible. Some examples are people who are hard-of-hearing or deaf, people with visual impairments, people with physical and mental disabilities, and more. Dr. Stover helped me to fine-tune my project to be social media instead of digital media as a whole. This is because including blog posts and other digital platforms would make the project too broad and impractical to do on my own. The platforms I will be educating people on are YouTube, Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, and TikTok. My target audience of people who will use my DH project is people who use these platforms as well as anyone who wants to make their social media more accessible to everyone. My purpose for this project is to show people that making their social media accessible is not as difficult as they may think it is. I also want to educate people on how they are excluding people by not doing these things, even unknowingly. I believe that if people are taught how to make their social media accessible in a user-friendly way, they will.

This project helps to further the conversation about how DH as a field of study can be made more accessible. Throughout my research I found that there are not many DH projects about accessibility nor are there many DH projects that are accessible themselves. I was trying to find other DH projects that are similar to reference but most of the time I came up short. Much of what I found was only articles about what it is like to have a disability and use social media. This is helpful to gain perspective on what accessibilities I need to make but it does not help me in seeing what else there is out there in DH. I will continue to look for more DH projects about accessibility in the DH field. I am glad that there don’t seem to be any DH projects like mine but also it’s disappointing that not many people are talking about accessibility in DH when it is so important. My project feels all the more important now, I want to teach people how to be more accessible with their social media and in turn how to be more accessible with Digital Humanities projects in the future.
