# I'm **Ashley Mentz** . . .

... and I am a senior at _Christopher Newport University_ and I am obtaining a Bachelor of Arts in Business Marketing and a minor in Communication Studies. I don’t know the exact career field that I want to go into but I am interested in social media marketing, branding, and advertising.

I currently work on-campus in the Athletics Department as a supervisor. I spend a lot of time in the ticket office selling tickets, helping customers, setting up sporting events, and monitoring employees under me. I currently run the Social Media accounts as the Historian for [Phi Sigma Pi](https://phisigmapi.org/), an honor fraternity I am a Brother of.

This past summer I was an intern for [Neighborhood Rescue of America](https://neighborhoodrescue.org/). This is a non-profit organization that helps to do turnarounds in low-income areas. I learned what it’s like to work in a non-profit and I primarily worked on the Social Media Team, helping to run their Instagram account. What drew me to Neighborhood Rescue was my passion for service. I have loved service ever since I became a [Girl Scout](https://girlscouts.org) when I was in grade school, which is still a sisterhood I value very much. I primarily utilize my membership to volunteer at summer camps as a counselor. 

Another way I continue to serve people is by being a Brother of [Alpha Phi Omega](https://apo.org), a service fraternity. My favorite service projects include making blankets for the homeless, making sandwiches for the hungry, and volunteering at races. I also am a sister of [Delta Gamma](https://deltagamma.org) where I am a member of Honor Board and I am the Director of Fundraising. 

In my spare time I enjoy dancing, hanging out with my friends, listening to music, going on walks, and playing virtual reality games like [The Sims 4](https://www.ea.com/games/the-sims/the-sims-4) and [Animal Crossing New Horizons](https://www.animal-crossing.com/new-horizons/). I also have a labradoodle named Bailey and a younger sister and I miss them both so much while I am at school. 

While my background and my interest in digital marketing is what initially drew me to **Digital Humanities**. I am excited to learn about the field and how I can use this knowledge in my career!
