title: My Second Grant Proposal Update
---

My grant proposal is about a Digital Humanities project centered around Accessibility and Social Media. It has been three weeks since my last update and there have been a few developments. I mentioned in my first grant update blog post that I was going to continue to look for more Digital Humanities projects on Accessibility, I have not had much luck. Most of the content I found about Digital Humanities and Accessibility is articles talking about why DH should become more accessible. This is what originally inspired me to write my grant proposal on this subject, the lack of DH projects on accessibility.

Since there are very few Digital Humanities projects on accessibility and none that I have seen on social media, I have to be quite expansive with my project. My project will act as a foundation for my Digital Humanities projects that are not only about accessibility but ones that are accessible themselves. I want to include as many resources and information as possible since I am basically starting fresh. I have looked into different websites and articles about accessibility to help me with this.

What I did find to be helpful was a website that Dr. Stover sent me called [Funkify](https://www.funkify.org/simulators/?v=f003c44deab6). It is a website that provides a free browser extension that allows users to see how disabled people experience the internet. This is very helpful for me to gain experience in different ways that social media is inaccessible for disabled people that I never would have realized. Apart from just this, the website also provides tips for how to make web pages more accessible to disabled people. Both the simulators and the helpful accessibility tips help me to create a more well-rounded project to help as many people as possible.

Throughout my grant-writing process I have come to learn how much the Digital Humanities field builds on itself. DH projects are often about taking what other people have done and expands and differentiates it. This is one thing I appreciate about Digital Humanities. While every project is different, every expansion and diversion from another project is welcome. Scholars creating projects based on each otherâ€™s work is celebrated and leads to expansive knowledge. When writing my grant proposal, I reference other projects and research and then what I add that differentiates my project from theirs. Although my project does not have many Digital Humanities projects to reference, I am grateful for the ones that I do have so I can spread more information about DH and accessibility.

As I near the end of writing my grant proposal I find myself reflecting on my process. I had the most difficulty writing my environmental scan because there are not many Digital Humanities projects on accessibility. Dr. Stover helped me to figure out what to write in this section so that it better adapts to my circumstances. I had a much easier time writing my grant narrative. This was the most fun for me because I got to talk all about my project and how I was going to do it. Writing the grant narrative made the project feel real and less theoretical. It also made me realize that I need to be more specific about what I am talking about, the more details the better. Through this process I have a better understanding and appreciation for DH as a whole. Writing my grant proposal has been an amazing experience that this class has given me and I look forward to showing Dr. Stover my final proposal.
