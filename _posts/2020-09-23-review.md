  The Map of Early Modern London is a Graphical User Interface (GUI) where a bird’s eye-view of London from about 1561. This map is interactive and customizable to fit your interests. The map itself is also known as the Agas map, after Ralph Agas, and Civitas Londinum. The original map no longer exists but a recreated one from 1633 does. This map has a legend on the right that contains the streets, homes, markets, churches, chapels, and more. One criticism I have is that the project puts link the the map itself before the link to the instructions. People might not know that there are instructions and have difficulty navigating the map. Once you click the directions, there are many unique features that the map allows. The options for controls are zooming, rotating, and changing the opacity of the map. There is also a navigation panel where one can search for a specific location. If you know the id of a particular location, you can search that as well. There is a legend on the side where you can click entire categories. If you want to see all the streets at once, for instance, you can. You can also click directly on the map if you want to know what something in particular is. The map also gives a description of each location that you can see when you click on it. This description tells the history of the location as well as links to other MoEML works where they appear. Bookmarks are also available if you want to return to certain locations. You can create PNG images as well. One downside is that this feature does not work on all browsers. It does work on Chrome and Firefox though. You can also edit and outline locations for your own use.

  This map is incredibly detailed and the drawings are very easy to read. No matter how closely zoomed in, the image is still clear. The breakdown of locations is very thorough and it helps to make sense of such a large space. I also liked how you can click multiple locations at once and you can visualize what it was like to go from place to place in 1561. The color coding also makes it easier to see more than one location at a time. The street names are written on the map as well as in the legend. Having the street names written on the map is helpful if one wanted to take a hypothetical route. It is also helpful because you can quickly see the name of a street without having to highlight it. The drawings are beautifully done and they help to give a visual of terrain to show the different hills and flat areas.
  
  A criticism I have is I would have liked to see a statement of the purpose of this project. I wish the website explained more of the importance of this map and why they wanted to create it. It is an amazing piece of history but what made them want to recreate it digitally? What sparked the idea for this project that would lead to so many others for them?
  
  Overall, I really enjoyed this project and I found it so amazing how interactive a map from 1561 can be. I feel like I’m back in that time. I would love to explore more of their projects and see what else they have to offer. I highly recommend this map to anyone who loves history, maps, or wants to get away from their ordinary life for a while.
