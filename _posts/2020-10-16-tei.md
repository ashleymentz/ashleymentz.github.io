title: My Reflection on my Experience with TEI Coding
---

  My class was assigned the project of coding different columns and pages of Charlotte Perkins Stetson’s *“The Yellow Wall-paper.”* I was personally assigned column 1 of page 648, the first page of full text. To code the text, we used TEI (Text Encoding Initiative) which creates a standard for how digital texts are represented. TEI standardizes XML (eXtensible Markup Language), which is a markup language similar to HTML. At first when I began the project I had no idea what I was doing and I was overwhelmed but I soon got the hang of it and I felt a lot better about coding. In this blog post I am going to be reflecting on the beginning of the project when we did “TEI on paper” and when we began to code using a computer program called Oxygen which allows the user to know whether they are coding correctly or not.

  The first step of the project was to “markup” the text using Google Docs. Wherever there was a new paragraph, quote, em dash, italics, or a mistake, it had to be annotated. The way we marked it was by highlighting the part of the text with the feature and making a comment noting what the feature was. This way, when we moved on to Oxygen, we could easily see what needed a special code. I found this part pretty simple as  I did not have many special characters apart from italics and em dashes. I am glad that we used Google Docs to markup the text first because if we had gone right into Oxygen I would definitely have been confused.

  Then, we moved on to Oxygen where we inputted the codes for the features of the text. Each feature had a specific code that went along with it and they each had a different way that they had to be inputted. For example, all you needed for a new paragraph was “<p>” at the beginning and end of a paragraph while italics needed a special code with the word embedded into it. When I first began using Oxygen I found it to be pretty simple especially since Oxygen puts a red square when you have done something wrong, as opposed to the normal green square. Everything was going well until I started to use italics. For all of the encoding I had been copying the designated code from Dr. Stover’s website and pasting it in Oxygen. This however, did not work for italics and I could not figure out what was going wrong but once I typed it out manually, it worked. 

  I enjoyed using Oxygen and I’m grateful that this class is introducing me to many forms of technology that I didn't know existed. I think it is a great resource and it is a fantastic program for beginners who are learning to code. This project allowed me to see what it takes to do a DH project myself and how much planning it takes to create a digitized version of something. I feel a lot more confident in my coding ability than when I started and I am excited to see the finished project.
